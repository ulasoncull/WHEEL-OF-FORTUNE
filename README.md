# WHEEL-OF-FORTUNE
There is only one player.
The game is played with a special wheel that determines the dollar value of the called letters. The wheel is split into 8 segments as
follows: 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, Double Money, and Bankrupt.
The computer randomly determines a word and then a player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word should be a country in
English such as Turkey, Germany, France, Italy, etc. There are 195 countries in the world.
The letters of the hidden word represented by tiles are face down. A player spins the wheel by naming the letters one-by-one to
solve the puzzle. Both consonants and vowels can be guessed by the player after spinning the wheel. If the player guesses a letter
that is part of the word, the computer writes it in all its correct positions. If the called letter cannot be found in the word, the player
cannot earn any money from this turn.
Before guessing a letter, a player must spin the wheel to determine how much each letter, if revealed. Every spin is risky because
the wheel also includes bankrupt, resulting in the loss of all earnings to that point. In the case of “Double Money” segment, the
current amount of money is doubled if the player guesses correctly.
The game is over when the player completes the whole word correctly. The player gets the money he/she earns.
